        <h2>My Dream Future</h2>
        <p>
            In the future I want to have either a public administration job or a job doing analytics for a board game or video game company. I also have thought about maybe working in events recently. Working at Climate Pledge Arena would be cool!
            <br><br>
            I would also like to try to write a book at some point. I want to live in a suburb in Washington in a house with a library and a garden with vine tomatoes and a chicken coop so I can cook my own egg and tomato sandwiches in the morning. I also want to visit every continent at least once.

        <h3>What I Learned While Making This Webpage</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <a href ="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp">The button tag</a>
                </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This article helped me learn how to make buttons. I used this tutorial and made some buttons using classes and was able to link my LinkedIn and Email using them at the beginning of the page!</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>
                <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.ASP">The div tag</a>
                </li>   
                    <ul>
                        <li>I also learned how to use the div tag. This tag makes dividers in your page. You can think about them like points on a webpage which can be later be referenced. I used them to jump to specific points in my page like jumping to the <a href = "#Start">start.</a> </li>
                    </ul>   
                <li>
                    <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_link_mailto">The mailto href attribute</a>
                </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I used this article to learn about the mailto attribute, which I can use in conjunction with the buttons to make a button that automatically opens the users email and puts in my email address as the recipient. This sometimes doesn't work but try it out!</li>
                    </ul>  
                <li>
                    <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_emojis.asp">html emojis!</a>
                </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I learned that HTML has built in emojis which is pretty cool. The whole list is here and I used it to make a style class for this list!</li>
                    </ul>
